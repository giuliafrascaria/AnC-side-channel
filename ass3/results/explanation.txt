The figures describe the latency when executing an instruction in the target
buffer triggering a page walk (compared to a base number of ticks observed
when the target address and its respective page table pages are cached).
The lighter the colour, the higher the latency.
Every column represents the specific cacheline offset which has been evicted.
Every row represents a page in the target buffer.
We ran our experiment for pages 32KB apart (or 8 PTEs) (heatmap_8pages_offset.png),
and 4KB apart (or 1 PTE).
The results, as expected, show the correlation between moving 32KB from the
target buffer and the latency between consecutive cacheline offsets since,
accessing a page 32KB from the target virtual address causes crossing a cacheline
at PTL1 (since a cacheline contains 8 PTE entries), resulting in a downwards
moving staircase.
